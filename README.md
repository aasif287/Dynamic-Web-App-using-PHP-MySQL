# Building a Dynamic Web App using PHP & MySQL

## Project Objectives

In this project, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

1. **Create databases, users, and tables in MySQL and create the database connection in PHP.**
2. **Apply PHP knowledge to capture and secure input from the user before sending it to the database.**
3. **Create the add, update, delete and retrieve functions in the PHP web app interacting with the MySQL database.**

By the end of this project, you will be able to create a simple note-taking web app using PHP and MySQL.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into 2 parts:

1. **Project Overview:** This introductory reading material.
2. **Building a Dynamic Web App using PHP & MySQL:** This is the hands-on project that we will work on in Rhyme.

## Task Structure

The hands-on project on Building a Dynamic Web App using PHP & MySQL is divided into the following tasks:

### Task 1: Introduction

By the end of Task 1, you will be able to describe the case for using PHP and MySQL in Back-end Development. You will be able to analyze the requirements for the note-taking application developed throughout the project. You will be able to describe the development environment and be familiar with it.

### Task 2: Preparing the Database

By the end of Task 2, you will be able to create user accounts, databases, and tables in MySQL through the phpmyadmin interface. You will be able to apply the requirements analyzed to specify the table schema and different fields.

### Task 3: Database Connection

By the end of Task 3, you will be able to create a database connection using PHP. You will be able to describe the different arguments required to initiate a connection from PHP to MySQL.

### Task 4: Capturing User Input

By the end of Task 4, you will be able to apply PHP and HTML knowledge to capture input data from the user. You will be able to evaluate the difference between the GET and POST HTTP methods.

### Task 5: Adding Records to the Database

By the end of Task 5, you will be able to create a webpage that adds new content into the backend database.

### Task 6: Retrieving Records from the Database

By the end of Task 6, you will be able to apply PHP and MySQL techniques to retrieve data from the database and dynamically change the HTML layout accordingly.

### Task 7: Deleting Records and Security

By the end of Task 7, you will be able to create the delete functionality, which deletes records from the database using PHP. You will be able to analyze some security threats while accepting data from the user. You will be able to understand how to validate input data from the user.

### Task 8: Updating Records

By the end of Task 8, you will be able to create the “update” functionality in the app, which allows users to edit previously existing content in the database.
